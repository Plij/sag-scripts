sag-scripts
===========

StreetArtGangs JavaScript library

Includes all needed Scripts to keep the game running. Later on, I will comment the code and add here in which Entities are the Scripts supposed to go, unless the Entities are created on runtime.

No 3rd party Libraries are needed to run these Scripts, all is included in Meshmoon + JavaScript itself.

TODO: 
      *Fix orientation on field players, currently not working and really not knowing why. Math should be okay.
      *Add sound effects by recording some in Oulu city.
